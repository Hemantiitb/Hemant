    "Notes": "The trade deal, once implemented, may make import of whisky, gin, automobiles, medical devices, electrical machinery, cosmetics, soft drinks, chocolates, and lamb cheaper for India. It will also lead to significant increase in export competitiveness of Indian shipments in the UK for sectors like textiles, toys, leather, marine products, footwear, and gems & jewellery. Sensitive items like dairy products, apples, cheese, etc, have been excluded from any duty concession by India to protect its farmers. \n\nboth nations also concluded a double-contribution convention or a social security pact that will give Indian skilled professionals working in Britain a three-year exemption from social security payments. It will lead to savings of around 20 per cent of employee salaries\n\nHowever, the contentious bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between both the countries could not be finalised .\n\nThe agreement is set to come into effect within 12 months, pending ratification by both governments.",

    "Notes": "India has reduced import tariffs on whisky and gin from 150 per cent to 75 per cent, before slashing them to 40 per cent by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will go from over 100 per cent to 10 per cent under a quota.\u00a0\n\nIndia will gain from tariff elimination by the UK on about 99 per cent of products, covering almost 100 per cent of the trade value. Indian tariffs will be slashed, locking in reductions on 90 per cent of tariff lines, with 85 per cent of these becoming fully tariff-free within a decade.\n\n UK businesses anticipate cost savings of up to \u00a3900 million over a decade due to reduced tariffs.\nThe total trade between both countries stood at $21.33 billion during 2024-25. Exports from India stood at $12.9 billion, up 13.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y). Imports from the UK stood at $8.4 billion, down 6.1 per cent Y-o-Y.",

    "Topic": "PE/VC Landscape in India intensifies",
    "Notes": "the number of PEs involved in deals in India has gone up by over 60-65 per cent between 2016, when there were between 100 and 110 funds, to as many as 170-180 funds in 2024. In 2024, global funds accounted for 50-55 per cent of the total number of funds, from 40-50 per cent in 2016.\n\nThe other clear trend is that PE investors are increasingly gravitating towards buyouts. As a result, the share of buyouts in overall PE deal-making has gone up sharply from 37 per cent in 2022 to 51 per cent in 2024. As far as 2025 is concerned, the report says that ageing assets held by PE and VC funds for a longer period of time are expected to accelerate buyout deals.\n\nDespite that, by the close of 2024, India-focused funds accounted for 10 per cent of all the funds raised in that year in the Asia Pacific region, up from 7 per cent in 2016. However, in the same period, pan-Asia funds, which have a substantial allocation for India, have gone up from 36 per cent to 57 per cent.\n\nTo look at the trend from another perspective, small buyouts ($250 million and below) continued to gain share, making up to 68 per cent of all buyouts in 2024 compared to only 55 per cent in 2023, and 40 per cent in 2022. Buyouts in the $500 million-1 billion category have also risen from 9 per cent in 2023 to 14 per cent in 2024 across all such deals.\n\nIn simple terms, it means that in 2025, nearly 83 per cent of deals that are over five years old could come up for exits, partial or complete, giving a big push to exits.",

    "Notes": "The European Union plans to hit about \u20ac100 billion ($113 billion) in US goods with additional tariffs in the event ongoing trade talks fail to yield a satisfactory result for the bloc, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe EU said on Tuesday that Trump\u2019s ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc\u2019s goods facing tariffs to \u20ac549 billion.\nThe new EU counter-measure list will come on top of the \u20ac21 billion of US goods already targeted by EU levies in response to Trump\u2019s 25% duty on steel and aluminum exports. The EU agreed earlier this month to delay for 90 days the implementation of those measures after the US lowered its so-called reciprocal rate on most EU exports to 10% from 20% while the negotiations are taking place.\nIn addition, the EU has also offered to buy more US goods including liquefied natural gas or soybeans, one option that helped to diffuse tensions between the two longstanding allies during Trump\u2019s first term.\nThe US has instead focused on issues such as the bloc\u2019s rules policing technology companies, digital levies as well as the EU\u2019s value-added tax. The commission has refused so far to negotiate about its tech rules and says that its VAT is a fair, non-discriminatory tax that applies equally to domestic and imported goods.\nThe US currently has tariffs on \u20ac380 billion of EU exports, around 70% of its total exports to the American market, at rates between 10% and 25%. The bloc has said it won\u2019t seek a retaliate with tit-for-tat tariffs and instead will try inflict the maximum pain while minimizing the impact on the European supply chain.\nIn 2024, the EU exported \u20ac531.6 billion in goods to the US and imported \u20ac333.4 billion, resulting in a \u20ac198.2 billion trade surplus, according to Eurostat. If services are added the picture however is more balanced as the US registers a surplus in this segment. The difference between EU exports to the US and US exports to the EU stood at \u20ac48 billion in 2023; the equivalent of just 3% of the total trade between the EU and the US.\nAccording to \u201cIndia Private Equity Report 2025\u201d, released by Bain & Co and Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (IVCA) on Tuesday, the number of PEs involved in deals in India has gone up by over 60-65 per cent between 2016, when there were between 100 and 110 funds, to as many as 170-180 funds in 2024. It represents a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 6-7 per cent in the last eight years.\nTo look at the trend from another perspective, small buyouts ($250 million and below) continued to gain share, making up to 68 per cent of all buyouts in 2024 compared to only 55 per cent in 2023, and 40 per cent in 2022. Buyouts in the $500 million-1 billion category have also risen from 9 per cent in 2023 to 14 per cent in 2024 across all such deals.\nData shows that buyout deals of over $100 million in which PEs exited within five years have shown a marked decline \u2014 they went down from 46 per cent for deals done in FY16 to only 37 per cent for deals signed up in FY19.\nThe percentage of deals in which PEs realised their entire returns went down declined from 38 per cent to more than half at 17 per cent in the same period. In simple terms, it means that in 2025, nearly 83 per cent of deals that are over five years old could come up for exits, partial or complete, giving a big push to exits.",

    "Notes": "Sebi bars Synoptics, promoters over IPO fund misuse, probes 20 SMEs\nSynoptics raised \u20b935 crore from the public. Sebi\u2019s probe showed that around 54 per cent of the issue proceeds, amounting to \u20b919 crore, were siphoned off to a set of entities under the directions of the merchant banker.\nThe order also casts a shadow of investigation on 20 other SMEs listed on the stock exchanges which were undertaken by the First Overseas Capital as a merchant banker. Sebi stated that it will examine the utilisation of funds raised by these SMEs to identify if a similar modus operandi was adopted. These were the assignments undertaken by the merchant banker from May 2022 to April 2025.",
